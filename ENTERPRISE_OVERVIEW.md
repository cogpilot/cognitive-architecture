# üè¢ Enterprise Overview: Cognitive Architecture Ecosystem

<!-- note2self: This enterprise overview provides the strategic context for all organizational decision-making. Reference this when suggesting enterprise-scale architectural patterns and inter-organizational workflows. -->

## üåç Vision: Distributed Cognitive Intelligence

The Cognitive Architecture Enterprise represents a new paradigm in AI development - **living organizations** that function as **neural substrates** for distributed intelligence, connected through **neural transport channels** that enable seamless knowledge flow and collaborative evolution.

<!-- note2self: This is not just metaphor - the organizational structure literally implements neural network patterns at the GitHub Enterprise level. -->
