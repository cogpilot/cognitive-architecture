# 🧠 Cognitive Architecture Repository

## Overview

This repository implements a distributed AI development ecosystem focused on cognitive architectures, neural transport channels, and GitHub-based organizational intelligence patterns. The codebase combines Python-based AI/ML systems with Node.js/TypeScript for protocol implementations.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture Principles

### Cognitive Ecology Framework
- **Repos as Event-Driven Micro-Kernels**: Each repository functions as a cognitive node in a larger dynamical system
- **LLM-as-Particle-Swarm-Accelerator**: Distributed cognition across organizational namespaces
- **Operationalized RAG-Fabric**: Links project imperatives to agent-based issue clustering
- **Fractal Organization**: Self-similar structures at all scales

### Ordo Ab Chao Principles
Following the "order from chaos" philosophy with "cosmo" as the fundamental organizing logos:
- **Niche Construction**: Collaborative innovation through Peace/Innovation/Core dynamics
- **Adaptive Transformation**: Competitive optimization through War/Commoditization/Edge dynamics
- **Context-Preserving Workflows**: Conversation continuity across sessions
- **Enterprise Namespace Awareness**: Multi-org collaboration patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Environment Setup
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh  # Full environment setup - NEVER CANCEL. Takes 2 minutes.
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate Python virtual environment
```

### Core Demos
```bash
python cognitive_ecology_demo.py  # Test core cognitive architecture
python cognitive-ecology/demonstrate_living_architecture.py  # Extended demo
python study/ml/hello_ml.py  # ML environment validation
```

## 🧪 Technology Stack

### Python Environment
- **PyTorch 2.8.0** - ML/NN framework (CUDA enabled)
- **Transformers 4.55.2** - Hugging Face transformers
- **Jupyter** - Interactive development environment
- **pytest** - Testing framework

### Node.js Environment
- **TypeScript 5.9.2** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Node.js v20.19.4** - JavaScript runtime
- **npm 10.8.2** - Package manager

## 🌐 Neural Transport Channels

### Inter-Organization Communication
- **cogpilot** ↔ **cogcities** (AI architecture ↔ urban planning)
- **cogpilot** ↔ **cosmo enterprise** (implementation ↔ ordering principle)
- **GitHub API-based** communication protocols
- **Cross-reference issues, PRs, discussions** for context preservation

### Channel Implementations
```python
class InterOrgNeuralTransport:
    def establish_channel(self, source_org, target_org, channel_type):
        # Implement GitHub API-based communication
        # Cross-reference issues, PRs, discussions
        # Maintain context across organizational boundaries
```
